#### GUI for Testing 

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py


### Project Explanation 

#### 1. Visual Representation

##### 1.1 Environment Visualization

    The system provides a clear and interactive visualization of the navigation graph, 
    including vertices (locations) and lanes (paths between locations).

- Vertices 
    - Each vertex is represented as a circular node .
    - Vertices are labeled with unique names .
    - Clicking a vertex allows spawning a robot or assigning a task
- Lanes 
    - Lanes are drawn as lines connecting vertices .
    - Color-coded based on status:

         - Green: Free

        - Yellow: Reserved (in use by a robot)

        -   Red: Blocked (collision or high congestion)

##### 1.1 Robot Visualization
    Robots are visually distinct and update in real-time as they move.

- Each robot is displayed as a colored circle with a unique ID.
- Status Indicators:

        ðŸŸ¢ Moving (Green)

        ðŸŸ¡ Waiting (Yellow)

        ðŸ”´ Blocked (Red)

#### 2. Robot Spawing 

##### Interactive GUI Spawning

    Users can spawn robots by clicking on any vertex.

- Clicking a vertex opens a popup to spawn a robot .
- Each robot gets a unique ID (e.g., "R1", "R2") .
- If a vertex is occupied, a warning is displayed .
